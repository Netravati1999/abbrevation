<blockquote cite="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph.html">
<p>A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces),
 or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one 
 paragraph ends and another begins.In most organized forms of writing, such as
 essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about.
 Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis 
 statement, which is the central idea of the essay.</p>
